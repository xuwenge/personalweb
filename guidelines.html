            <h1>Guidelines for Adding Spectator Audience in VR Games </h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enabling spectator feedback as a main priority</strong>
                    <p>
                        Based on the social cognitive theory, people who receive
                        encouraging messages tend to increase their effort to accomplish
                        their objectives, resulting in positive outcomes.
                        Our study in the paper <a
                            href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1079132/full">
                            Exploring the effect of the Group Size and Feedback of non-player
                            character spectators in virtual reality exergames
                        </a> also confirmed that having spectator feedback based
                        on players’ actions could boost their performance and enhance
                        their game experience. Therefore, we suggest that exergame
                        designers/researchers should include some type of spectator
                        support and encouraging messages whenever players are making
                        good progress, for instance, (1) when their performance has
                        achieved a certain level (e.g., combos moves), (2) when their
                        performance has resulted in good outcomes (e.g., taking the lead
                        in rounds won), and (3) when their performance has prevented
                        the opponent from performing well (e.g., blocking an opponent’s
                        action). This feature should be considered regardless of the group
                        size of the spectator audience—as our results showed, even a
                        relatively small number of spectators (N = 40) has led to a positive
                        effect on players’ performance and gameplay experience.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Adding larger spectator audience</strong>
                    <p>
                        Our results in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1079132/full">
                            Exploring the effect of the Group Size and Feedback of non-player
                            character spectators in virtual reality exergames
                        </a> show that a larger number of spectator
                        NPCs has the potential to enhance the gameplay experience. We
                        list some examples of how the spectator NPCs can be added to the
                        other exergames according to the degree of locomotion the player
                        has in VR: (1) <strong>Low</strong>: in exergames that the player mostly remains at
                        the same location [e.g., VirusBoxing, Beat Saber4, Hot Squat,
                        spectators/supporters can be added behind the player, alongside the
                        objects’ flying area, or placed at a higher location where the game
                        objects are initialized. (2) <strong>Medium</strong>: in exergames where players only
                        need to move in a limited in-game distance (Eleven Table Tennis
                        VR), spectators can be added around the users but with a small
                        distance. A good example is the Creed: Rise to Glory. (3) <strong>High</strong>:
                        in exergames where players need to move their in-game position
                        on a large scale (e.g., VR cycling games), the
                        spectator could be placed alongside the playing or track field (e.g.,
                        placing the spectators next to the street for VR cycling games). I also sketched
                        out this in the paper, please refer to the Figure 1 for the example.

            <h1>VR Game Design Recommendations for Older Adults Players</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Include an audience and feedback that reacts
                        to players’ movements in VR exergames</strong>
                    <p>
                        Based on our fndings in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-023-00780-5">
                            Cheer for me: effect of non-player character audience feedback on older adult users of
                            virtual
                            reality exergames</a>, including an audience (even composed of generic NPCs) and its
                        feedback
                        reacting to the players’ movements can improve the performance and enhance the gameplay
                        experience
                        for elderly players. Therefore, we suggest including an audience and providing positive feedback
                        whenever the elderly players are making good progress, the term "good progress" can be varied
                        across games, please define this based on the game you are designing. In addition, according
                        to the qualitative feedback from participants, we observed that the number of NPC models for
                        the audience and the number of embedded audio and visual feedback are two other factors that
                        need to be taken into account; in general, more models and a diverse
                        range of visual and audio feedback are needed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gesture customization or adaptive exertion level
                        for older adult users</strong>
                    <p>The following solutions could be adopted depending on the exertion requirement of the exergame.
                        When all movements can achieve the desired exertion of the exergame, possible solutions are
                        (1) providing the players with a list of movements and enabling them to select their preferred
                        gestures, or (2) allowing the players to customize the gestures; both approaches could lead to
                        a better and more personalized experience. When some movements cannot achieve the desired
                        exertion
                        level but are necessary to help players reach a certain exertion level, a possible approach is
                        to
                        apply an adaptive exertion level (e.g., automatically changing the intensity and requirement of
                        a movement/gesture, such as squatting lower and closer to the ground for it to be counted
                        as a successful move in more advanced levels) for each participant based on each individual’s
                        physical ability level, exercise demands, and performance in the game. This guidelines are From
                        my paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-023-00780-5">

                        <li>
                            <p>As Perceived Usefulness had a positive effect on
                                Chinese older adults’ intention towards VR exergames,
                                VR game desginers of these games should (1) make sure a game
                                is sufficient to provide health benefits to these older
                                adults, and (2) highlight the health benefits these older
                                players could obtain and how effective the game could
                                provide these benefits to the elderly users.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Use natural and simple motions (e.g., punching, slicing,
                                dancing) for VR exergames as these motions are easy to
                                use–Perceived Ease of Use is a positive predictor of
                                Chinese older adults’ intention to use VR exergames. In
                                addition, no additional facilitation conditions are
                                needed by default when the game only uses easy-to learn,
                                straightforward, and natural motions.</p>
                            <p>To be honest, interaction used by games should be as simple as possible.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>VR exergame producers should provide various in-game
                                achievements to encourage further gameplay. One way
                                to achieve this is to use a badge system.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>VR exergames should enable social interaction within
                                these games and encourage older adults to play together
                                in groups or at least with another friend since many
                                participants (N = 42 out of 51) have expressed the need to play
                                with other players or for others to watch them play.
                                Studies suggest that social interaction could help older
                                adults exchange tips for better performance and, as
                                such, could make them more engaged in a game.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Consideration should be given to the demographics of
                                the population. For instance, dancing games should
                                involve some type of Chinese style dances. Chinese
                                songs can also be provided in rhythmic-based and dancing games.
                                Multiplayer features should be supported
                                since the Chinese elderly are quite social and prefer to
                                play with their peers. Overall, games targeted at Chinese
                                older adults should consider the demographics of this
                                population and adapt the games to them. This can be
                                done with surveys or playtesting while developing
                                the exergames.</p>
